# Griddy Assessment

**Andrew Maney**

Hi Griddy 👋🏻

Here is the code for my assesment.
Running it should be pretty straightforward.

To install the dependencies just run `npm install`.

And `npm start` will start the server on port 5000.

I am using SQLite for the database. The entire db is stored in `griddy.db`.
If the database is broken for whatever reason, just run `npm clean`.
This can also be used to wipe all the data.
